# Dataset

_OpenAQ_

Global, aggregated physical air quality data from public data sources provided by government, research-grade and other sources.

# Business Problem

Air pollution is a global public health concern that kills more people each year than HIV/AIDS and malaria combined. According to the WHO, one out of every eightdeaths in the world is due to air pollution. Air pollution has various health effects. The health of susceptible and sensitive individuals can be impacted even on low air pollution days. Short-term exposure to air pollutants is closely related to COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, asthma, respiratory disease, and high rates of hospitalization (a measurement of morbidity).

# Project Objective

Often, specific solutions to improving air quality are local and sustained through public engagement, policy and monitoring. Both the overarching science of air quality and health and local solutions rely on access to reliable, timely air quality data. Following are the some points which will discussed:

- Descriptive analysis of air pollution index of different countries.
- How the parameters in the dataset like CO2,CO,NO etc. affect different places?
- How these parameteres affected during COVID-19?
- Predict air quality based on historical data.
